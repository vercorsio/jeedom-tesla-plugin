# 1.1.0 (2018-12-04)
### Features
* Control driver and passenger temperatures.
* Control trunk, frunk and sunroof openings.
* Control charging limit.
* Display temperatures in `°C` or `°F` following car settings
* Display distances in `km` or `miles` following car settings


## Improvements
* Added hover effects on buttons.
* Optimize and clean code (added a css file shared among templates, ...)

### Known issues
* [Temp settings] Due to a limitation in Tesla API, we cannot toggle from `SYNC` to `Not SYNC`. Thus we only can set passenger temp when `Not SYNC` is already selected in the car.
